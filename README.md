I've always wanted a more effective way to track my personal goals, so I built this addon. If you're like me, there are probably plenty of things you still want to achieve, and keeping track of them can be tricky. With the Personal Quest Log, you now have your very own customizable quest log!

## üîñ Features

- Automatically generate quests for vendor items requiring resources.
- Track specific item quantities or currencies needed to complete your goals.
- Create custom groups, quests, and goals to tailor your experience.
- Set up multiple profiles for different characters.
- Move quests between groups to stay organized.
- Choose from a variety of themes to personalize your log.
- Collapse groups to manage quests for future completion.
- Create custom goals with manual completion options.

## üìù Feedback & Updates

I'm planning regular updates, including new features like weekly and daily quest tracking.
